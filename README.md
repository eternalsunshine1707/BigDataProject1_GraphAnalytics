# <u> CSCI 6444: INTRODUCTION TO BIG DATA &amp; ANALYTICS </u>
# Project 1: Graph Analytics
<u> <b> Project Description </b> </u><br>
The dataset is a graph of links of opinions from the SOC-E website, also known as a trust
network of the Epinions website. Users could express trust in each other, forming a "web
of trust" to determine which reviews were shown to each user. This dataset has anonymized names replaced by numbers. It's medium-sized with 10
million nodes and edges indicating trust relationships.

I completed a project that helped me understand how to work with datasets and create graphs
from them, especially those that have a medium to large scale. During this project, I gained
practical experience in developing my own functions, using the igraph and sna packages, and
working with R. I also acquired expertise in making graphs more understandable by charting
and visualising them, simplifying them, and modifying their parameters. This project covered
a range of graph analytics tools that provided me with valuable insights into the structure and
interactions within the graph.

I have learned about important metrics that help me understand the issue space, such as power
centrality, longest paths, greatest cliques, egos, and alpha centrality. I have also studied how
random walks can help me identify communities within a graph. By understanding these
metrics, I can identify patterns, structures, and connections within data, and develop efficient
methods for analyzing and visualizing complex networks.

After completing this project, I now feel confident in my ability to utilize R for handling
large datasets, generating and visualizing graphs, applying diverse functions and metrics to the
graphs to extract different insights about the problem domain, and simplifying the graphs for
improved analysis.
